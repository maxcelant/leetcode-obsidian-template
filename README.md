# Leetcode Practice Obsidian Template

This is meant to help those who are struggling with organizing their leetcode journey, and want a structured approach with spaced repetition built in.

This template allows you to take a defined approach to each problem. It focuses on three main **fundamentals**:

1. "How can I make the insight to lead to discovering the solution?"
2. "What are the important aspects of the solution?"
3. "Where did I go wrong?"

This obsidian template also gives you a couple of nice-to-haves.

#### Spaced Repetition
The best way to retain your knowledge and learn from your mistakes is to continuously retrain your brain with spaced repetition. This can be easily achieved with the help of my [obsidian-recall](https://github.com/maxcelant/obsidian-recall) plugin which will put the problems you haven't performed in `X` days into adesignated folder of your naming.

#### Problem Template
Using the obsidian command palette, you can use the pre-defined problem template by doing `CMD + d` (on Mac) and then `Templates: Insert template` -> `Problem Template`.

#### Tagging System
Depending on your preference, you can tag your problems with difficulty, data structure / algorithm, etc, so that you can easily sort and retrain specific groups of problems.

#### Insights
If you learn anything profound to your understanding, you should jot it down in the designated `/insights` folder.
